This project , devolped in spring break of 2025 , tells new comers what affect rental price by how much, so fornginers like me don't get skinned

there are already ML projects like @ to predict "fair price" , if you looking for 1 simple number i recommandto check out

this project is meant to dive into the specific relation between price and  each feature, like:

-what makes the initial deposit low.?

-how distance to nearest station and closeness to downtown affect price differently , by how much?

- etc.. name your relasion

So you can balance between walk distance and property location for the best ban of buck. or know what to look for low deposit in
